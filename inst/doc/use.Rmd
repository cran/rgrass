## Introduction

The original R-GRASS interface [@bivand:00; @neteler+mitasova:08] was written mainly to permit R objects represented as **sp** class objects to be moved to GRASS, and GRASS objects to be moved to R for statistical analysis. From **spgrass6** 0.6-3 (April 2009) following a fruitful workshop at Queen's University, Belfast, the interface was re-written to use the `--interface-description` flag provided for each GRASS command, also used by the Python interface to GRASS commands. Command interface descriptions are parsed from XML and cached as R objects for efficiency. The current version of the R-GRASS interface is contained in this package, **rgrass**. In addition, an R function `initGRASS()` was written to permit GRASS to be started from within GRASS to which we will return below.

## Starting R inside GRASS

When starting GRASS GIS from a terminal console (here GRASS 8.2.0), one can continue in the GRASS terminal console, starting an interactive R session from there (here R 4.2.1). Loading and attaching the R-GRASS interface package **rgrass** in the R session, we see that the current GRASS location is detected and reported:

```
$ /home/rsb/topics/grass/g820/bin/grass /home/rsb/topics/grassdata/nc_basic_spm_grass7/rsb

```
Since **rgrass** *knows* the current location, we can for example use `execGRASS()` to list GRASS rasters in the PERMANENT mapset in the standard North Carolina basic data set (https://grass.osgeo.org/sampledata/north_carolina/nc_basic_spm_grass7.zip):

```
> execGRASS("g.list", type="raster", mapset="PERMANENT")

Done.

Goodbye from GRASS GIS
```
Leaving R returns us to the GRASS terminal console, which we can also exit.

R can also be started within the GRASS GUI, by choosing the console tab, and entering for example `rstudio`, or another R graphical user interface. This screendump shows the same listing of rasters in PERMANENT in `rstudio`:

```{r, out.width=800, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("rstudio_in_GRASS.png")
```

## Starting GRASS inside R

From **spgrass6** 0.6-3, it has also been possible to start a GRASS session from a running R session using the `initGRASS()` function. This is done by setting GRASS and environment variables from the R session (https://grass.osgeo.org/grass-stable/manuals/variables.html).

It may be useful to set an environment variable to the value of `GISBASE`, as shown for example in the GRASS terminal console:

```
GRASS nc_basic_spm_grass7/rsb:github-rsb > echo $GISBASE
/home/rsb/topics/grass/g820/grass82
```

Starting R with such a suitable environment variable set lets us retrieve it later when needed. When loaded and attached, **rgrass** reports that it seems that GRASS is not running:

```
$ GRASS_INSTALLATION=/home/rsb/topics/grass/g820/grass82 R

> library(rgrass)

```

Starting GRASS from R may use a temporary or an existing GRASS `LOCATION`.

### Temporary GRASS location

If we don't pass an existing location to `initGRASS()`, a temporary GRASS location will be created and set.

Here we'll use a raster file provided with **terra**:

```
> library(terra)
terra 1.6.0
> f <- system.file("ex/elev.tif", package="terra")
> r <- rast(f)
```
The first argument to `initGRASS()` is `gisBase=`, which here we are passing the value of the environment variable after checking that it is a directory. The second argument is where to write the `GISRC` file. The third is a template raster (here a `"SpatRaster"` object) from which to clone the temporary location size, position, resolution and projection:

```
> GRASS_INSTALLATION <- Sys.getenv("GRASS_INSTALLATION")
> file.info(GRASS_INSTALLATION)$isdir
[1] TRUE
> loc <- initGRASS(gisBase=GRASS_INSTALLATION, home=tempdir(), SG=r, override=TRUE)
```

If the `gisBase` argument is missing, `initGRASS()` will do a minimal effort of guessing it.
Firstly, if a `GRASS_INSTALLATION` environment variable is availabe, then its value will automatically be used for `gisBase`.
If not, then the system command `grass --config path` will be tried to get the value of `GISBASE` that corresponds to the GRASS installation in the system PATH (if any).

As can be seen, `initGRASS()` creates not only environment and GRASS variables, but also many files in the location mapsets; `g.gisenv` also shows details:

```
> list.files(file.path(loc$GISDBASE, loc$LOCATION_NAME), recursive=TRUE)
[1] "file28aaf6dc1c44c/WIND"          "file28aaf6dc1c44c/windows/input"
[3] "PERMANENT/DEFAULT_WIND"          "PERMANENT/PROJ_EPSG"            
[5] "PERMANENT/PROJ_INFO"             "PERMANENT/PROJ_SRID"            
[7] "PERMANENT/PROJ_UNITS"            "PERMANENT/PROJ_WKT"             
[9] "PERMANENT/WIND"                 
> execGRASS("g.gisenv")
GISDBASE='/tmp/Rtmpe7QdVd';
LOCATION_NAME='file28aaf5be4b905';
MAPSET='file28aaf6dc1c44c';
GRASS_GUI='text';
```
We may now write R objects to the temporary GRASS location for manipulation and analysis, here calculating slope and aspect layers:

```
> write_RAST(r, vname="terra_elev")

```

### Existing GRASS location

Similarly, GRASS may be started in an R session with an existing location by providing the `gisDbase=`, `location=` and `mapset=` arguments with valid values:

```
$ GRASS_INSTALLATION=/home/rsb/topics/grass/g820/grass82 R
