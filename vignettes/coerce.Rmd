## Introduction

The original R-GRASS interface [@bivand:00; @neteler+mitasova:08] was designed to move raster and later vector data between R and GRASS GIS. To do this, use was made of intermediate files, often using the external GDAL library on both sides. On the R side, the **rgdal** package was used, interfacing GDAL and PROJ as GRASS GIS also did. The GRASS commands `r.in.gdal`, `r.out.gdal`, `v.in.ogr` and `v.out.ogr` were matched by **rgdal** functions using the same underlying external libraries:


```{r, out.width=500, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig1.png")
```

GDAL was supplemented for raster data by simply reading and writing uncompressed binary files using `r.in.bin` and `r.out.bin`, with custom functions on the R side. As then written, the R-GRASS interface used **sp** classes for both raster and vector data, supplemented more recently with **sf** classes for vector data only.

The current version of the R-GRASS interface has been simplified to use the **terra** package because it, like **sf** and **rgdal** before it, links to the important external libraries. The workhorse driver is known as `RRASTER`, and has been widely used in **raster** and **terra** (see also (https://rspatial.org)). It uses GDAL but writes a flat uncompressed binary file. Using `terra::rast()` also appears to preserve category names and colour tables, but needs further testing (see (https://github.com/rsbivand/rgrass/issues/42)).

```{r, out.width=500, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("fig2_p7_RRASTER_GRASS.png")
```

From GDAL 3.5.0, the `RRASTER` driver also supports WKT2_2019 CRS representations; in earlier versions of GDAL, the driver only supported the proj-string representation (https://github.com/rsbivand/rgrass/issues/51).

These changes mean that users transferring data between R and GRASS will need to coerce between **terra** classes `SpatVector` and `SpatRaster` and the class system of choice. In addition, `SpatRaster` is only read into memory from file when this is required, so requiring some care.

## Loading and attaching packages

This vignette is constructed conditioning on the availability of aforementioned R packages, i.e. if some were missing at the time of package building, some code blocks will not be displayed.

The setting below, needed before loading **sp**, is to prevent **sp** from relying on **rgdal** or **rgeos**.
Those packages will retire by the end of 2023 [@pebesma_r-spatial_2022].

```{r}
Sys.setenv("_SP_EVOLUTION_STATUS_"="2")
```

```{r include=FALSE, message=FALSE}
terra_available <- requireNamespace("terra", quietly=TRUE)
sf_available <- requireNamespace("sf", quietly=TRUE)
sp_available <- requireNamespace("sp", quietly=TRUE)
stars_available <- requireNamespace("stars", quietly=TRUE) && packageVersion("stars") > "0.5.4"
raster_available <- requireNamespace("raster", quietly=TRUE)
```

On loading and attaching, **terra** displays its version:

```{r, eval=terra_available}
library("terra")
```

```{r, eval=sf_available}
library("sf")
```

```{r, eval=sp_available}
library("sp")
```

```{r, eval=stars_available}
library("stars")
```

```{r, eval=raster_available}
library("raster")
```

`terra::gdal()` tells us the versions of the external libraries being used by **terra**:

```{r, eval=terra_available}
gdal(lib="all")
```

When using CRAN binary packages built static for Windows and macOS, the R packages will use the same versions of the external libraries, but not necessarily the same versions as those against which GRASS was installed.



## `"SpatVector"` coercion

In the **terra** package [@terra], vector data are held in `"SpatVector"` objects. This means that when `read_VECT()` is used, a `"SpatVector"` object is returned, and the same class of object is needed for `write_VECT()` for writing to GRASS.


```{r, eval=terra_available}
fv <- system.file("ex/lux.shp", package="terra")
(v <- vect(fv))
```

These objects are always held in memory, so there is no `inMemory()` method:

```{r, , eval=terra_available}
try(inMemory(v))
```

The coordinate reference system is expressed in WKT2-2019 form:

```{r, , eval=terra_available}
cat(crs(v), "\n")
```

### `"sf"`

Most new work should use vector classes defined in the **sf** package [@sf; @sf-rj]. In this case, coercion uses `st_as_sf()`:

```{r, eval=(terra_available && sf_available)}
v_sf <- st_as_sf(v)
v_sf
```

and the `vect()` method to get from **sf** to **terra**:

```{r, eval=(terra_available && sf_available)}
v_sf_rt <- vect(v_sf)
v_sf_rt
```

```{r, eval=(terra_available && sf_available)}
all.equal(v_sf_rt, v, check.attributes=FALSE)
```

### `"Spatial"`

To coerce to and from vector classes defined in the **sp** package [@asdar], methods in **raster** are used as an intermediate step:

```{r, eval=(terra_available && raster_available && sp_available)}
v_sp <- as(v, "Spatial")
print(summary(v_sp))
```

```{r, eval=(terra_available && sf_available && sp_available)}
v_sp_rt <- vect(st_as_sf(v_sp))
all.equal(v_sp_rt, v, check.attributes=FALSE)
```

## `"SpatRaster"` coercion

In the **terra** package, raster data are held in `"SpatRaster"` objects. This means that when `read_RAST()` is used, a `"SpatRaster"` object is returned, and the same class of object is needed for `write_RAST()` for writing to GRASS.

```{r, eval=terra_available}
fr <- system.file("ex/elev.tif", package="terra")
(r <- rast(fr))
```

In general, `"SpatRaster"` objects are files, rather than data held in memory:

```{r, eval=terra_available}
try(inMemory(r))
```

### `"stars"`

The **stars** package [@stars] uses GDAL through **sf**. A coercion method is provided from `"SpatRaster"` to `"stars"`:

```{r, eval=(terra_available && stars_available)}
r_stars <- st_as_stars(r)
print(r_stars)
```
which round-trips in memory. 

```{r, eval=(terra_available && stars_available)}
(r_stars_rt <- rast(r_stars))
```

When coercing to `"stars_proxy"` the same applies:

```{r, eval=(terra_available && stars_available)}
(r_stars_p <- st_as_stars(r, proxy=TRUE))
```
with coercion from `"stars_proxy"` also not reading data into memory:

```{r, eval=(terra_available && stars_available)}
(r_stars_p_rt <- rast(r_stars_p))
```

### `"RasterLayer"`

From version 3.6-3 the **raster** package [@raster] uses **terra** for all GDAL operations. Because of this, coercing a `"SpatRaster"` object to a `"RasterLayer"` object is simple:

```{r, eval=(terra_available && raster_available)}
(r_RL <- raster(r))
```
```{r, eval=(terra_available && raster_available)}
inMemory(r_RL)
```

The WKT2-2019 CRS representation is present but not shown by default:

```{r, eval=(terra_available && raster_available)}
cat(wkt(r_RL), "\n")
```

This object (held on file rather than in memory) can be round-tripped:

```{r, eval=(terra_available && raster_available)}
(r_RL_rt <- rast(r_RL))
```

### `"Spatial"`

`"RasterLayer"` objects can be used for coercion from a `"SpatRaster"` object to a `"SpatialGridDataFrame"` object:

```{r, eval=(terra_available && raster_available && sp_available)}
r_sp_RL <- as(r_RL, "SpatialGridDataFrame")
summary(r_sp_RL)
```

The WKT2-2019 CRS representation is present but not shown by default:

```{r, eval=(terra_available && raster_available && sp_available)}
cat(wkt(r_sp_RL), "\n")
```

This object can be round-tripped, but use of **raster** forefronts the Proj.4 string CRS representation:
```{r, eval=(terra_available && raster_available && sp_available)}
(r_sp_RL_rt <- raster(r_sp_RL))
cat(wkt(r_sp_RL_rt), "\n")
```


```{r, eval=(terra_available && raster_available && sp_available)}
(r_sp_rt <- rast(r_sp_RL_rt))
```
```{r, eval=(terra_available && raster_available && sp_available)}
crs(r_sp_RL_rt)
```

Coercion to the **sp** `"SpatialGridDataFrame"` representation is also provided by **stars**:

```{r, eval=(terra_available && stars_available && sp_available)}
r_sp_stars <- as(r_stars, "Spatial")
summary(r_sp_stars)
```

```{r, eval=(terra_available && stars_available && sp_available)}
cat(wkt(r_sp_stars), "\n")
```

and can be round-tripped:

```{r, eval=(terra_available && stars_available && sp_available)}
(r_sp_stars_rt <- rast(st_as_stars(r_sp_stars)))
```
``
```{r, eval=(terra_available && stars_available && sp_available)}
cat(crs(r_sp_rt), "\n")
```
